# #071 TinyBlink

A simple blink sketch with an ATTINY85-20PU on a breadboard.

Here's a quick video of it in action:

## Notes

The objective here is to demonstrate an ATTINY85-20PU chip running independantly on a breadboard.

I'm programming it with Arduino ISP, see the [ProgrammingWithArduinoISP](../ProgrammingWithArduinoISP) project for details on uploading the sketch.

## Notes

The PX835 music chip is usually listed as something like
"16 Kind of Sound Doorbell Chip Music Voice Module For DIY/Toy".

I obtained it from a seller on aliexpress, but I can't find any current listings for the chip.

The chip runs on 3V, and is silent at power-on, and supports two input push-buttons (pull-up to V+):

* play next/change song
* repeat last song

It apparently supports a "0.5W to 2W" output. With an 8Ω 0.5W speaker, I got best results with a 47Ω resistor in series.

The sound generated appears to be a PWM tone:
